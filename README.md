Heart Disease Prediction using Classification Models 		
•	Developed a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
•	Analyzed a dataset containing patient attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics
•	Preprocessed and cleaned data, handled missing values, and performed feature scaling to ensure model accuracy.
•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to select the best-performing model.
•	Implemented and optimized the final model to achieve an accuracy of 98%, enabling better predictions for early detection of heart disease.
•	Utilized Python, scikit-learn, and pandas for data analysis and model building
